I need a calendar and none of the one a saw in the nearby shop satisfied me so I
decided to use my beloved LaTeX to make one.

Searched the debian packages for latex calendar packages. Found:

  kalender -- Create a calendar, in German.
  calxxxx -- Prints a card-size calendar for any year.
  termcal -- Print a class calendar.
  yplan -- Daily planner type calendar.
  bbcard -- Bullshit bingo, calendar and baseball-score cards.
  pst-calendar -- Plot calendars in "fancy" ways.

I'm interested in a daily/weekly planner, with either a day or a week by page.
calxxxx, bbcard are then excluded. pst-calendar is for the one you hang on the
wall, not pocket-sized like I desire.

kalender isn't installed and is in german.

yplan is a perl script that creates a calendar... but only the .sty files are
present and yplan can't be found in my current repositories.

termcal is an interesting one... good for weekly classes... but not for me, as
using it would be the same as using a tabular.

also looked at

(and more, but this one was the best I found)
Good, but uses alien packages... I want something I can easily share, so no
debian package outside:

So, off I go! Gonna try to hack my own :) I think I'll have a look to the
numbering system of termcal

Looking at the code is hard... I need more experience with latex counters.

Conclusion: a pure LaTeX solution will take too much time to develop. I'd rather
write a python script that writes the latex for me (for now: the ideal is to
create a pure LaTeX solution, since python lovers are only a part of LaTeX
users)
