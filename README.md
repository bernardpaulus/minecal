About
=====

My attempts at producting a calendar using LaTeX.

The goal is to produce a 1 or two pages per week calendar, with space
to write spendings, possibly in a pocket-sized format

Current state
=============

A one-week sheet is done, using a landscape page

TODO
====

* produce approximately the same thing, for a portrait page:
  That will ease the layout within the cells
* write a python script to automate the day numbering
* add a header with the month, a fortune cookie... :)
